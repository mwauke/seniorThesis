Contemporary scholarship guidelines require that authors cite every source they use when composing a given work. The fear of plagiarism accusations and the desire to give credit to past scholars guarantee that authors provide footnotes and bibliographies. As a result, readers can then learn the source materials from which authors derive their information. However, the standards for citation are much stricter now than they were in centuries past. While it is now unacceptable to quote another author without providing a precise reference to the page number of the work from which the words were taken, this was a common practice in ancient literature. At that time, there were not standard editions of works with set reference numbers. Thus the concept of precise and consistent citation as we have it today is relatively new. 

Another difficulty that arises in scholarship on ancient sources is the prevalence of references to no longer extant works. In the current era, if someone does not cite a quote or idea, it is relatively easy to track down the source using simple internet search methods. However, sometimes even when an ancient author attributes a quote to another work, it is not guaranteed that the text still exists at all. For example, although Plutarch names Cratinus’ play The Chirons when providing a quote about Pericles’ bizarrely-shaped head, this play is now lost to us. Thus we have no way of reading the context of the quote and learning more about the source. This can be incredibly frustrating at times, as we are unable to gain a fuller understanding of what exact texts authors and editors consulted. 

This thesis concerns the Venetus A, the oldest complete manuscript of the Iliad. It contains not only the text of the poem, but scholarly commentary, or scholia, as well. These scholia surround the Iliadic text and provide notes on subjects such as grammar and mythology. The Venetus A, being a tenth century A.D. manuscript, does not follow the same protocol for citation as works do today. However, before delving into the people and works referenced in the scholia, a digression on the background of the Venetus A and Homeric epics is necessary.

In order to understand research on this manuscript of the Iliad, one must first have an understanding of the poem itself, specifically of its origin and transmission. The origins of the Homeric epics, the Iliad and the Odyssey, have long been a subject of debate among scholars. Some, such as Martin West, maintain that these poems were written by one single poet. Many scholars who subscribe to this theory of the belief that “the artistry, cohesiveness, and sheer monumentality of the Iliad and the Odyssey...prove that such marvels of artistic achievement must have required the technology of writing” (Nagy 30).

However, other scholars believe that the Homeric epics were originally orally composed rather than written. This is a theory which has existed for centuries, and which has gathered growing evidence to support it. In his 1795 Prolegomena to Homer, Friedrich Wolf proposes the possibility that the Iliad “and other poems of those times were not consigned to writings, but were first made by poets in their memories and made public in song, then made more widely available by the singing of the rhapsodes” (Wolf 69). Wolf uses this theory to explain the “many differences” among the written forms of the Homeric epics. The 1930s fieldwork of Milman Parry and Albert Lord provide more information on the logistics of oral composition. In The Singer of Tales, Lord explains how by observing bards in Yugoslavia, he and his teacher Parry were able to witness the process of oral composition in performance. As Lord describes it, “All singers use traditional material in a traditional way, but no two singers use exactly the same material in exactly the same way” (Lord 63). In this way, bards in Yugoslavia and bards in ancient Greece worked from traditional frameworks, but each gave their own unique telling.  

In Homeric Questions, Gregory Nagy continues with this theory. He argues that it is misleading to use the phrase “Homer wrote” when discussing these epics because of both their oral nature and their lack of a single author (Nagy 27). He also provides a timeline of the composition and transmission of the epics, with the poems being a product of pure oral tradition beginning in the second millennium B.C. and extending to the middle of the first millennium. It was at this point which point they began to interact with writing, eventually transitioning to a completely written format (Nagy 42).

In this introduction, I have given significantly more attention to this oral theory of the origin of the Homeric epics, as I feel the evidence for it far outweighs the arguments against it. Regardless of one’s opinion on the original composition of the Iliad, it is clear that it was eventually written down. Nagy records that the written versions of the Iliad most likely began in the middle of the sixth century B.C (Nagy 42). Just as the Iliad and the Odyssey are now considered foundational works of western literature, so too were they revered in the classical and Hellenistic periods. The Iliad received an extraordinary amount of study, with scholars creating their own commentaries and editions. Three specific editors, Zenodotus, Aristophanes, and Aristarchus, who were at different times the heads of the library of Alexandria, are frequently referenced in the scholia of the Venetus A.

The editions of these editors are unfortunately not extant, and have not been for quite some time. As Wolf notes, at the time the scholiast of the Venetus A was working, "the recensions and interpretations of the leading critics...no longer circulated among the learned in complete form" (Wolf 172). Thus even references to these editors in the scholia are likely taken from other scholars' works on the Alexandrian editors' editions. Wolf laments that "there is not enough left even of those major critics from whose authority our text was first derived to permit us to understand their abilities or their methods of emendation" (172).

It is at this point which I can now return to the initial discussion of references to and within ancient works. As stated previously, the Venetus A contains both Iliadic text and commentary in the form of scholia. In order to determine what line or phrase a scholion is discussing, the system of lemmata is used throughout this manuscript. In this system, many scholia begin with a lemma, a few words which usually correspond to the beginning of the line of Iliadic text in question on the page. This allows the reader to more easily find the word or phrase which is being discussed in the comment. However, this is not the only way in which the comments are anchored to the text.  
Throughout the manuscript, there are often symbols written to the left of certain lines of the Iliad. These are referred to as “critical signs.” As Bird notes in his section on critical signs in Recapturing a Homeric Legacy, “critical signs are not unique to Venetus A, although they are more fully used in it than in any other surviving Greek manuscript” (Due 95). Often, a sign will appear next to a line, and the corresponding scholion will explain why the sign was placed there. That is, these signs indicate that there is a comment in the margin about some feature within the marked line. There are different possible types of signs, with each type giving a general indication of the category of the comment. Possible reasons a line receives a critical sign are, according to Bird, “whether a given line should be removed or ‘athetized,’...or if a group of lines has, in Aristarchus’ opinion, been written in the wrong place” (Due 89).

In the preface to his edition of Homeric scholia, Karl Wilhelm Dindorf explains that these critical signs are unique to Aristarchus (Nam Aristarchus his solum signis usus erat, Dindorf XIX). That is, Aristarchus himself used these signs in his editions and commentaries (Due 90).
