unit of classification: individual scholion

Features to identify:
presence of a critical sign on the line and on the scholion
- diple
- dotted diple
- asteriskos
- obelos  


Placement of the scholion on the page: will help in identifying differences in the types of scholia
- main
- interior
- intermarginal
- interlinear
- exterior


presence of a ὅτι scholion: will help me analyze this specific formula and see what common features scholia which contain it might share
- the first word of the scholion is ὅτι (will most likely be more precise) OR
- one of the first three(?) words is ὅτι (will include scholia that being ἡ διπλη ὅτι, but will also include some false positives)


presence of a proper name in the scholion, such as editors
- Aristarchus
- Zenodotus
- Aristophanes

Representing thousands of scholia as a set of features that they do or do not contain will make analysis simpler, as I will be able to extract scholia which have the specific features I want to investigate. For example, if I want to examine the scholia which mention Zenodotus but do not have a dotted diple, the binary identification of these features will make this easy.
