unit of classification: individual scholion

Features to identify:

presence of a critical sign on the line and on the scholion: will be interesting to see co-occurrences with other features, such as editors' names. Additionally, interesting to see when both the line and scholion have a mark, or one but not the other.
- diple
- dotted diple
- asteriskos
- obelos  


Placement of the scholion on the page: will help in identifying differences in the types of scholia
- main
- interior
- intermarginal
- interlinear
- exterior


Presence of a ὅτι scholion: will help me analyze this specific formula and see what common features scholia which contain it might share
- the first word of the scholion is ὅτι (will be more precise) OR
- one of the first three(?) words is ὅτι (will include scholia that begin ἡ διπλη ὅτι, etc., but will also include some false positives)


Presence of a proper name in the scholion, such as editors: will help me classify what type of comments appear in scholia which reference different editors. 
- Aristarchus
- Zenodotus
- Aristophanes
- Homer? (would possibly be interesting to see when he is referenced. Also, perhaps the adjective ὁμηρκός)

Presence of a quotation: will be interesting to see co-occurrences with editors' names and possibly critical signs. 
- quotation from elsewhere in the Iliad 
- quotation from the Odyssey
- quotation from a non-Homeric work


Representing thousands of scholia as a set of features that they do or do not contain will make analysis simpler, as I will be able to extract scholia which have the specific features I want to investigate. For example, if I want to examine the scholia which mention Zenodotus but do not have a dotted diple, the binary identification of these features will make this easy.
