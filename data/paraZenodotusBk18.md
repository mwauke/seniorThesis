1. The chorus of the Nereids is athetized in Zenodotus as having the character of Hesiod.

2. in Zenodotus, “ἀγορεῦσαι,” and this appears to be the Homeric usage [line has ἀγορεύσατ’] (18.142)

3. in Zenodotus, “ἡμέτερον δὲ και Θέτις τανύπεπλον ϊκάνεις” [line reads τίπτε Θέτι τανύπεπλε ἱκάνεις ἡμέτερον δῶ] (18.385)

4. in Zenodotus, “ἡμέτερον δὲ και Θέτις τανύπεπλον ϊκάνεις” [line reads τίπτε Θέτι τανύπεπλε ἱκάνεις ἡμέτερον δῶ] (18.424)

5. In Zenotodus, “λινὸς δε ὑπο καλὸν ἀειδε,” but Aristarchus does not wish for it to say “string,” but some type of song, “the linos,” just as if it said “he sang a song (παιαν)” or something of that sort. For this reason, the sign is here. [line has λινον] (18.570, diple)

6. in Zenodotus, “διὰ ῥαδαλόν,” but Aristophanes has “παρὰ ῥαδαλόν.” One must understand ραδαλον as “having good branches through its height.” And Dionysius says that it is written “δονακῆεν,” corresponding with neither. [line has παρα ῥοδανὸν δονακῆα] (18.576)

7. in Zenodotus, “τοὺς δὲ κύνες μετεκίαθον τοὺς λέοντας.” And “ἕλκετο is without the “ϊ.” [line has ἕλκετο τὸν δὲ κύνες μετεκίαθον ἠδ‘ αἰζηοί] (18.581)

8. in Zenodotus, “αρεσθαι” [line has ἑλέσθαι] (18.501)

9. in Zenodotus, “ἀγορεῦσαι,” and this appears to be the Homeric usage [line has ἀγορεύσατ’] (18.142)

10. in Zenodotus and Aristophanes, “παρέξομαι” [line has παρέσσεται] (18.466)

11. in Zenodotus and Aristophanes, “ἀμφοτέρωθεν.” The Massalian has “ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἐπίπνυον αμφις αρωγοι.” [no reference to diple] (18.502, diple)

12. in Zenodotus, “πῶυ μεγ οιων” [line has πώεα καλὰ] (18.528)

13. "ἐς αυτην," in Zenodotus, and this writing has sense. (18.565)

14. in Zenodotus, “Αριηδνι” [line has Αριαδνῃ] (18.592)

15. in Zenodotus, “κρατερον” with the “ο” [line has κρατερήν] (18.477)

16. in Zenodotus, and in most, “ἀποκταμένου.” And this writing is not unlikely. [line has αποφθιμενου] (18.499)

17. in Zenodotus and Aristophanes, “αυτος,” with the “ο,” in order that he be without his arms.  This writing has an elegant expression and is not unreasonable. [line has αυτως] (18.198)
