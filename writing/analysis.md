The topic modeling discussed in chapter (?) provided me with some preliminary ideas of the relation of Aristarchus to the intermarginal zone. However, I decided to continue exploring this relation of the Alexandrian editors to certain scholia zones and to certain critical signs. In this analysis, I first chose to focus on Zenodotus and his co-occurrence with the dotted diple. 

In order to do this, I first had to identify every reference to Zenodotus in the scholia. This was easy to do because of the HMT's use of personal name URNs for every person mentioned in the Iliadic text and scholia. I next obtained the scholia URN for each of the scholia in which these Zenodotus references appeared. I then shortened this list to include only distinct scholia. If I did not do this, then certain URNs would appear multiple times in the instances in which Zenodotus was mentioned more than once in a single scholion. I then obtained the Iliad line numbers on which each of these distinct scholia were commenting. I compared this list of line numbers with the line numbers which had dotted diples next to them. The results, broken down by scholia type, can be found [here](https://github.com/mwauke/seniorThesis/blob/master/data/zenodotusScholia.csv). 

Slightly less than half (44%) of the main scholia which reference Zenodotus are commenting on lines which have dotted diples next to them. The intermarginal and interior scholia contain fewer references to Zenodotus. However, there are also fewer intermarginal and interior scholia in the manuscript. Zenodotus scholia make up about 8% of all main scholia, 6% of all intermarginal scholia, and a little less than 3% of all interior scholia.
