The topic modeling discussed in chapter (?) provided me with some preliminary ideas of the relation of Aristarchus to the intermarginal zone. However, I decided to continue exploring this relation of the Alexandrian editors to certain scholia zones and to certain critical signs. In this analysis, I first chose to focus on Zenodotus and his co-occurrence with the dotted diple. 
In order to do this, I first had to identify every reference to Zenodotus in the scholia. With this list, I obtained the scholia URN for each of the scholia in which the references appeared. I then shortened this list to include only distinct scholia. If I did not do this, then the same URNs would appear multiple times in the instances in which Zenodotus was mentioned more than once in a single scholion. I then obtained the Iliad line numbers on which each of these distinct scholia were commenting.
