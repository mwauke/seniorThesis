The topic modeling discussed in chapter (?) provided me with some preliminary ideas of the relationship between Aristarchus and the intermarginal zone. However, I decided to continue exploring this relation of the Alexandrian editors to scholia zones and to critical signs. 

Before I began this thesis, I had previously briefly examined the appearance of Zenodotus with dotted diples over a small sample size of three books (17, 18, 19) of the Venetus A. A common way to begin scholia connected to critical signs is “ἡ διπλη ὅτι” (the sign is there because) or simply just "ὅτι" ([the sign is there] because). Scholia which correspond to dotted diples frequently reference Zenodotus with the phrase "ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος γράφει” ([the sign is there] because Zenodotus writes...), introducing the disagreement between Zenodotus and Aristarchus. However, this is not the only formula for citing Zenodotus. The form "παρά Ζηνοδότῳ" also occurs throughout the scholia, yet it does not seem to be associated with any critical sign.

Of the nineteen occurrences of "παρὰ Ζηνοδότῳ" in books 17-19 of the Venetus A, only two appear in scholia which have corresponding critical signs, neither of which are dotted diples. However, 22 of the 24 occurrences of "ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος γράφει" coincide with a critical sign. This observations suggests that "ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος γράφει" is Aristarchan language. That is, it was transmitted along with the dotted diples, which Dindorf tells us are signs unique to Aristarchus. This leaves the question of the "παρὰ Ζηνοδότῳ" formula. Because it does not appear to coincide with any critical sign, we cannot assume that it is Aristarchan language. This formula perhaps comes from a separate source. In order to obtain a better idea of what this different citation pattern means, it would be beneficial to analyze its usage throughout a larger sample size of books. By examining every occurrence of "παρὰ Ζηνοδότῳ" in 18 books of the Venetus A and keeping track of each scholion’s zone and whether is has a corresponding critical sign, I will gain  a more thorough understanding of how this formula is used and if it seems to be specific to a type of comment.

Beyond these two formulas for citing Zenodotus, I intend to look at other common patterns that appear within the scholia. Another area to explore is the instances of obeloi in the manuscript and the scholia which correspond to them. As Wolf notes, Aristarchus “was the most severe of all in exercising his function [of the obelos].” Thus it might prove useful to extract all of the scholia which correspond to obeloi and see if there is a common way of explaining the presence of the obelos. From an initial, cursory glance, it appears that athetized lines do not contain as many “ὅτι” scholia as do lines with diples or dotted diples. However, I must examine the obeloi over a larger collection of books in order to confirm this or understand the significance.

The two features which I first chose to examine together more thoroughly were references to Zenodotus and occurrences of dotted diples. As I mentioned in the introduction, a dotted diple next to a line indicates that Zenodotus's and Aristarchus's readings of the line differ. Thus I wished to see how frequently these two features co-occurr in order to observe the strength of this relationship.

In order to do this, I first had to identify every reference to Zenodotus in the scholia. This was easy to do because of the HMT's use of personal name URNs for every person mentioned in the Iliadic text and scholia. I next obtained the scholia URN for each of the scholia in which these Zenodotus references appeared. I then shortened this list to include only distinct scholia. If I did not do this, then certain URNs would appear multiple times in the instances in which Zenodotus was mentioned more than once in a single scholion. I then obtained the *Iliad* line numbers on which each of these distinct scholia were commenting. I compared this list of line numbers with the line numbers which had dotted diples next to them. The results, broken down by scholia type, can be found [here](https://github.com/mwauke/seniorThesis/blob/master/data/zenodotusScholia.csv). 

It is important to look at these features by scholia type because there are significant differences in the amounts of each type of scholia. Slightly less than half (44%) of the 286 main scholia which reference Zenodotus are commenting on lines which have dotted diples next to them. The intermarginal and interior scholia contain fewer references to Zenodotus (75 and 23, respectively), as well as lower percentages of corresponding dotted diples (22% and 30%, respectively). Zenodotus scholia make up about 8% of all main scholia, 6% of all intermarginal scholia, and a little less than 3% of all interior scholia. Only six interlinear scholia reference Zenodotus, and there are no mentions of him at all in the exterior scholia. In total, there are 298 dotted diples in the Venetus A manuscript. 46% of them appear next to lines which have Zenodotus scholia commenting on them. This analysis shows that there is indeed a strong connection between this editor and this sign, but they do not always occur together. In addition, it reveals that the explanation for the dotted diple most frequently appears to be in the main scholia. This is something which can be explored more thoroughly when I analyze specific phrases, rather than just names, in the scholia. [see below]

I next decided to conduct a similar analysis, but this time focusing on Aristarchus and the diple (undotted). The diple's purpose is much broader than that of the dotted diple. It simply indicates that the line it is next to contains some interesting language usage. The results of this analysis, again broken down by scholia type, can be found [here](https://github.com/mwauke/seniorThesis/blob/master/data/AristarchusScholia.csv). There are only 35 more scholia which reference Aristarchus in the main than in the intermarginal (271 and 236 references, respectively). This is significant considering there are over 2000 more main scholia than there are intermarginal scholia. Thus Aristarchus scholia comprise 7.5% of main scholia, but 19% of the intermarginal scholia. There are 104 interior scholia which reference Zenodotus, making up 12.6% of the interior scholia. In total, Aristarchus makes more appearances than Zenodotus, as there are 615 Aristarchus scholia and 390 Zenodotus scholia. However, the lines which Aristarchus scholia comment on do not as frequently have co-occurring diples. The Aristarchus scholia in the main, intermarginal, and interior zones comment on lines which have diples next to them around 22% of the time (25% main, 20% intermarginal, 21% interior). These results show that Aristarchus has a stronger presence in the scholia, but he is not as strongly correlated with the diple as Zenodotus is with the dotted diple. However, the fact that Aristarchus scholia comprise a significant portion of all intermarginal scholia coincides with the topic modeling results, which revealed that a majority of the scholia which relate strongly to the Aristarchus category fall in the intermarginal zone. This observations builds an even stronger case for the possibility of an Aristarchan source that was used for the intermarginal scholia. 

As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to continue my analysis of Zenodotus scholia and dotted diples. However, I decided to narrow the observations down to the co-occurence of dotted diples with scholia which contain the phrase "ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος" ("the sign is there because Zenodotus..."). I extracted the instances of this phrase in the scholia, then obtained the line URN for each of these. Then, I compared this against the list of lines with dotted diples next to them. There are 205 instances of "ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος" in the scholia, and 142 of these occur in scholia which are commenting on lines marked with the dotted diple. Thus this pattern of language
