Just as the Iliad and the Odyssey are now considered foundational works of western literature, so too were they revered in the classical and Hellenistic periods. The Iliad received an extraordinary amount of study, with scholars creating their own commentaries and editions. Three specific editors, Zenodotus, Aristophanes, and Aristarchus, who were heads of the library of Alexandria during the third and second centuries BC, worked extensively on the Iliad and created their own commentaries and editions. Their work was very influential in shaping the text of the Iliad that we have today. However, the editions of these editors are unfortunately not extant and have not been for quite some time.
 
 The Alexandrian editors’ editions of the Iliad are referenced constantly throughout the scholia in the Venetus A. Aristarchus’ name appears especially frequently in the scholia. His presence in the scholia of this tenth-century manuscript reflects over 1000 years of transmission of his work on Homer. This question, then, intends to trace back over 2000 years in order to reconstruct possibly pure Aristarchan material in the scholia. It is my goal to be able to determine the features which are associated with Aristarchan language and thereby create a model for determining with some confidence whether a scholion is Aristarchan or post-Aristarchan.
 
 To be able to label something as Aristarchan, I will examine specific words and patterns of language in the scholia, as well as occurrences of critical signs. My goal in this thesis is not to claim that I have found some magical indicator of what comments come from what editor. However, I intend to identify significant clusterings of features that, when occurring together, suggest from where a scholion does or does not derive. In order to be able to classify a scholion as Aristarchan or non-Aristarachan, it is necessary first to define what makes something Aristarchan. That is, what features, when considered together, represent a model of the Aristarchan category of scholia? 
 
Critical signs, as we know from Dindorf, are unique to Aristarchus. Because he included these signs in his own edition and they were transmitted along with the text, we can assume that the presence of a critical sign on a line indicates that a scholion on that same line is Aristarchan material.

The "hoti" formula refers to a common way of beginning a scholion. "ὅτι," meaning "because" is often the first word of a scholion wich is commenting on a line which has a critical sign on it. It is meant to explain the presence of the sign. Thus formula stands for "The sign is there because..." Because this word occurs so frequently with critical signs, it is likely that it was transmitted with the signs and is therefore Aristarchan.

An active form of the verb γράφω (to write) in the scholia is almost always governed by Zenodotus. That is, he is the only person who is said to write. Moreover, this formula of "Ζηνόδοτος γράφει" is one which commonly appears in hoti scholia. Because of the hoti scholia's link to Aristarchus, the presence of an active form of γράφω can also be considered an Aristarchan feature. 

A reference to Zenodotus can be an indicator of Aristarchan material. However, it depends on with what formula he is referenced. If it is "ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος...", as mentioned above, then the scholion is likely to be Aristarchan. On the other hand, if the name Zenodotus appears in the form "παρὰ Ζηνοδότῳ," then we cannot assume that this is Aristarchan. This is because, as described in the analysis chapter, this formula does not appear to be associated with any critical signs. The same can be said about references to Aristophanes. The phrase "παρὰ Ἀριστοφάνει" also appears several times throughout the scholia, with no strong association with critical signs. 

The presence of Aristarchus' name himself is likely an indication that the scholion is post-Aristarchan. This is based on the assumption that Aristarchus was not writing in the third person about himself. Rather, the presence of his name indicates some scholar at a later time writing about him and his work on the *Iliad*.

The presence of a reference to a city edition in the scholia is likely a reference to post-Aristarchan material. As demonstrated in [this table](https://github.com/mwauke/seniorThesis/blob/master/data/cityEditions.md), when city editions are mentioned, editors names are also frequently mentioned along with them. Aristarchus himself is often cited, as well as the other editors, or even all three together. 

The presence of a post-Aristarchan scholar's name obviously indicates that the scholion is taken from a source that is later than Aristarchus. 

With this in mind, I gathered the boolean value for each of these features for every scholion in the main, intermarginal, and interior scholia. I have decided to exclude the interlinear scholia from this analysis because they very rarely reference editors, as they are often single-word glosses. Additionally, I chose to exclude the exterior scholia because there are relatively few of them (240), and they also do not reference editors. 

In order to complete this process systematically, I wrote a script which goes through every scholion and checks whether it contains the given features I am interested in this analysis. Certain features were more difficult than others to isolate. For example, in order to check which scholia contained a reference to a post-Aristarchan scholars, I first had to determine who the post-Aristarchan scholars were. The Homer Multitext's authority list of all of the names referenced in the Venetus A contains 1098 entries. I was able automatically to extract only the names which appear in the scholia. However, this still left 631 names. In order to create a list of post-Aristarchan scholars mentioned in the scholia, I had to manually go through each name and consider their time-period in relation to Aristarchus. Some of the names, such as Iliadic characters and other fictional people, were easy to eliminate. However, this process required a fair amount of research, as some ancient grammarians are especially obscure. However, after sifting through all 631, I arrived at a list of 44 names of people whom I could confidently place as being later than Aristarchus. There were a few instances of people who were contemporary with Aristarchus. In these cases, I decided to exclude them from the list, as I do not know with any certainty whether Aristarchus himself would be writing about them. Thus this list is reserved for those who are purely post-Aristarchan. In my original version of the script, I placed Aristarchus himself in the list as well. However, I later decided to remove his name, making two separate features: the presence of the name Aristarchus and the presence of the name of a post-Aristarchan scholar.  

Two other features I decided to include in this analysis were the scores for each scholion within Topic 6 (the Aristarchan language topic) and Topic 9 (the talking about Aristarchus topic) from the topic model results discussed earlier. Each scholion has a score for each topic which denotes how strongly the language in that scholion corresponds to the language which is associated with the topic in question. The scores range from 0.0-1.0, with 0.0 being not at all related, and 1.0 being 100% related. I decided to include these scores in the list of features because I wanted to see how they corresponded to the presence or absence of other Aristarchan features. My final list of features which I chose to extract for each scholion were 

1. The presence of a critical sign on the line on which the scholion comments
2. The presence of γράφει, the 3rd person singular active form of γράφω 
3. The presence of ὅτι as the first word in the scholion
4. The presence of παρὰ Ζηνοδότῳ
5. The presence of the name Aristarchus
6. The presence of the name of a post-Aristarchan scholar
7. The Topic 6 score for the scholion
8. The topic 9 score for the scholion

To call this a list of Aristarchan features is misleading, as it is a mix of features which indicate Aristarchan language and which indicate the opposite. Thus it is more appropriate to refer to this as a list of features which point toward or away from Aristarchus. Items 1-3 on the list are all features which are positively associated with Aristarchan language. That is, The presence of the boolean value "true" for any one of these features on a scholion increases its likelihood of containing Aristarchan language. Itmes 4-6 are all features which are negatively associated with Aristarchan language. That is, the presence of the boolean value "true" for any one of these features on a scholion decreases its likelihood of containing Aristarchan language. The last two features are the only non-boolean ones, but their function is not terribly different. If a scholion's score is closer to 1, that means that it is "more true" that its language matches that of the topic. A higher score for Topic 6 indicates that the language of the scholion aligns more with the language of the Aristarchan language topic, whereas a higher score for Topic 9 indicates that the language of the scholion aligns more with he language of the topic which talks about Aristarchus. 

The files containing every feature for each scholion in the main, intermarginal, and interior zones can be found here: [main](https://github.com/mwauke/seniorThesis/blob/master/data/aristarchanFeaturesData/updated-msA-Aristarchan.tsv), [intermarginal](https://github.com/mwauke/seniorThesis/blob/master/data/aristarchanFeaturesData/updated-msAim-Aristarchan.tsv), [interior](https://github.com/mwauke/seniorThesis/blob/master/data/aristarchanFeaturesData/updated-msAint-Aristarchan.tsv). In addition, a table with the sums of the occurrences of these features by scholia type can be found [here](https://github.com/mwauke/seniorThesis/blob/master/data/aristarchanFeaturesData/scholia-features2.csv). 

This table shows the significance of having "presence of the name Aristarchus" as a feature. Aristarchus appears in 7.6% of main scholia, whereas this name appears in 19% of intermarginal scholia and 13% interior scholia. This coroborates what the topic modeling results revealed, i.e. that scholia which mention Aristarchus appear with disproportiate frequency in the intermarginal zone. The post-Aristarchan name feature also shows an interesting pattern across the scholia types. Of the 264 scholia which contain the name of a post-Aristarchan editor, 238 of these fall in the main zone. This indicates that scholia which use post-Aristarchan sources are most frequently main scholia. 

This table also provides the amount of scholia in each zone which have scores above .5 and .9 for both topic 6 and topic 9. The most immediate difference here is that 18% of the intermarginal scholia have scores above .5 for topic 9. This is significantly greater than the proportion of main scholia with scores above .5 for this same topic (3.5%). This observation, just as the previous one, further suggests the connection of the intermarginal zone with scholia which reference Aristarchus. 

Another piece of information provided in this table is how many scholia in each zone contain all of the Aristarchan features and none of the post-Aristarchan features. This is defined as a scholion having a value of true for items 1-3 on the feature list, and a value of false for items 4-6. I chose not to include topic model scores in this definition for the sake of simplicity. In the row "All Aristarchan Features" the amount of scholia which meet all of these criteria for each of the main, intermarginal, and interior zones can be seen. The main scholia have  113 scholia in this category, whereas the intermarginal have 14, and the interior 9. 

So far, none of this data has revealed that certain scholia zones are reserved for one specific purpose or source and nothing else. However, it does suggest more generally which zones are more likely to contain certain types of comments. From this table, it appears that both Aristarchan scholia and post-Aristarchan scholia fall in the main zone. However, scholia which directly mention Aristarchus are most often in the intermarginal. The interior zone's distributions are often similar to those of the intermarginal, though 

The ultimate goal for this data is to create an Aristarchan classifier which is able to take a scholion and determine (as best it can) if the language is Aristarchan or not. However, before any such classifier can exist, some manual work must be done in order to have a sample set of scholia which are defined as Aristarchan or post Aristarchan. Thus my next step, upon gathering these features, was to collect a random sample of 100 scholia from the main, intermarginal, and interior zones, and read each one and assign it a label based on the language it contained. It quickly became apparent that this task was not as simple or clear-cut as it sounds. There are many scholia which are difficult or even impossible to classify in this binary way. This is because, as demonstrated above, I have a limited set of features which hint that a scholion is Aristarchan. However, this by no means indicates that these are the only features of Aristarchan language. That is, just because a scholion does not contain γράφει and ὅτι, this does not mean I can definitively say it is not Aristarchan. Nor, however, can I claim it is definitively post-Aristarchan if it does not contain any of the post-Aristarchan features. Because of the many scholia which contained nothing to cause me to lean one way or the other, I created a third label, "indeterminate."
