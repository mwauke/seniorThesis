Through the analyses I have conducted during this thesis, I have recognized several features within the scholia which indicate that a scholion contains language directly from Aristarchus. Moreover, I have also been able to identify features which indicate that a scholion comes from after Aristarchus. These post-Aristarchan scholia can be either paraphrases of Aristarchan material, or scholia which reference editors who flourished after Aristarchus. With the use of the HMT's digital editions of the Venetus A, I was able to find and extract information for nearly any feature of the scholia that I was interested in learning more about. Thus, one of the most difficult problems I encountered was determining which features would be most significant in my effort to recover Aristarchan material in the manuscript. 

As I have explained, the only way to settle on a finite list of features was to observe the general patterns which appear across the books of scholia. From my initial observations form topic modeling results, I saw that Aristarchus’ name appeared with disproportionate frequency in the intermarginal scholia. With this in mind, I decided to see what other differences appeared across the scholia zones and with certain editors' names. 

Thus, my ultimate set of Aristarchan and non-Aristarchan features came to be a collection of various types of information that I was able to obtain from the digital editions. The presence of corresponding critical signs, different patterns of language, and personal names were all features which the Homer Multitext project’s editions marked and which I simply needed to extract. The topic modeling results required slightly more work to obtain, but ultimately derived from the HMT’s editions as well. By combining all of these features for every scholion in the main, intermarginal, and interior zones,  I was able to create a list of scholia which showed how Aristarchan or post-Aristarchan each scholion was, based on the cluster of features I had defined. However, I did not set some arbitrary identifier (e.g. 2 Aristarchan features means conclusively Aristarchus) to label the scholia as Aristarchan or not. Rather, after manually labeling a random set of scholia, I used this as a model for the remainder of the scholia.

With all of the data I gathered and features I clustered together, I have made significant progress toward being able to identify scholia which contain Aristarchan language directly from his no longer extant editions. The scholia which appear to contain true Aristarchan language most frequently appear in the main scholia. The main scholia, the largest scholia zone, is not reserved only for Aristarchan material, however. Scholia which reference post-Aristarchan editors also most frequently appear in the main zone as well. However, as the topic modeling results suggested, the scholia which directly reference Aristarchus show up significantly more in the intermediate, and to a lesser degree, interior zones. These observations point towards Aristarchan and post-Aristarchan sources being used as the sources for the main scholia and reworkings and paraphrases of Aristarchus’ editions being the sources for the intermarginal and interior zones. 

As I explained in the introduction, at the time of the construction of the Venetus A, the editions of the Alexandrian editors were already not extant. However, it is likely that their editions were copied, and thus some of the scholia which are in the Venetus A are direct transmissions from Aristarchus’ edition from the 2nd century BC. Only through this systematic, large-scale analysis of the recurring features in the scholia was it possible to gain a sense of the different types of comments which appear in the manuscript and how they are distributed. In this thesis, I have not identified every scholion which contains Aristarchan language. Rather, I have created a model for identifying which scholia are more likely Aristarchan, Aristarchan paraphrases, and post-Aristarchan. With this Aristarchan classifier, I have demonstrated that it is possible to recover some directly Aristarchan material, despite his edition being long gone. In addition, I have shown how these different sources are distributed among the various scholia zones. Through this work, I have attempted to respond to the scholars who, over the centuries, have lamented the dearth of information concerning the sources for the Venetus A manuscript.
