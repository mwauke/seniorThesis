1. What is the significance of the difference in language of "παρά Ζηνοδότῳ" and "ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος γράφει" and why does the latter occur more often with a critical sign?
2. What is the frequency of other types of language used in scholia accompanying critical signs? Do they mean different things?
3. Must the "ὅτι" occur within the first three words of the scholion (excluding lemmata) for it to be considered a "ὅτι scholion?"
4. Why do lines with obeloi get ὅτι scholia less frequently than do lines with diples or dotted diples?
5. Is there a uniting factor among ὅτι scholia that do not have a corresponding critical sign?
