I. Extract every instance of "παρά Ζηνοδότῳ" and "ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος γράφει" from all of the scholia we have archived.   
  
  A. For each of these, also make note of whether or not there is a critical sign on the line which the scholion is commenting.  
  B. Read through some of these two types of scholia and determine if there is a difference in content (e.g. agreement for one, disagreement for the other)
  C. Determine if one type of language occurs more frequently with certain types of scholia.
  
II. Extract the first three(?) words of scholia on lines with critical signs, excluding the lemmata.

  A. Categorize different ways in which these scholia begin (το σημειον, ὅτι Ζηνόδοτος, etc)
  B. Are there certain patterns of language that correspond to specific critical signs?
  
III. Determing if a scholion which has ὅτι in the middle of the comment should be considered a ὅτι scholion. If so, the method for identifying a ὅτι scholion must be modified.
IV. Extract every line which has an obeloi next to it
  A. Look at all of the scholia on each of these lines and extract how many ὅτι scholia there are. Is there simply a different formula for explaining obeloi than diples?
V.
